# OC-robot_commander
This set of scripts allows you to control an OpenComputers robot from OC computer using buttons. 
It is also possible to use easyish scripts to create action sequences. 

# DISCLAIMER:
This script isn't even done yet. You can currently move ~~only up and down.~~ in all directions (Have been busy working on the backend stuff.)

the buttonAPI is originally created by dw20 (minecraft youtuber) for ComputerCraft and ported by a guy in [here](https://oc.cil.li/index.php?/topic/255-button-api-now-for-oc-updated-9-6-2014/), so 99,9% of credits goes to there as well.

BUT, i have updated it to include the additional feature made after it was ported. so the original demo in the link above **won't** work.

# To use:
1. download a copy of the repo and unzip it

2. Move files below to corresponding folders

                 "FILE:"                "WHERE"                "ON:"
                 
            "helpers.lua"               "lib"                "computer" and "robot"
                 
            "buttonAPI.lua"             "lib"                "computer"
            
            "Robot_Commander.lua"       "root"               "computer"
            
            "robot_Remote.lua"          "bin"                "computer"
            
            "robotLib.lua"              "root"               "robot"

3. navigate to `home` directory on the robot (boots here by default) type the command `edit .shrc` and add the following `/robotLib.lua`.

4. Ensure that both the computer and the robot have a linked card.

5. You'll have to use T3 server or a creative case. (by default you need T3 graphics card and the linked card is also T3)

6. Create an issue if you can't get it to work.

7. Pastebin links to come:

# Scripting
The `robot_Remote_Script.lua` is a program that runs the script specified in arguments.

**You'll need to have the `robot_Remote.lua`, `helpers.lua` and `robotLib.lua` like in the manual commader. also do step 3 of the usage instructions.**

the `demoScript.txt` file is a simple script.
###### Currently supported commands:

`move:<direction>` direction `[F,B,L,R,A,U,D]` move/turn the robot to the direction specified, 

   if invalid direction gives response `move:NIL_done` >> Parsed by `robot_Remote_Script.lua` to user readable format.
  
`reboot` reboots the robot, if setup correctly it should start robotLib automatically.

`quit` quits the robotLib program.

`connected` simply sends back a confirmation that the robotLib is running.

`wait:<int>` sleeps for specified amount of time in seconds. the robot won't accept other commands while doing so.

If command vas invalid the robot vill give a `nil_command` response, which is parsed by `robot_Remote_Script.lua` to user readable format.

###### You can also run the script commands manually 
Typing `robot_Remote '-r' <one of the commands above>`.
  
`-r` is optional parameter that will wait for the response from the robot.
